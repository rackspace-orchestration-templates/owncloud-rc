  #### Getting Started
  If you are new to [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/), check out their

  interface](http://doc.owncloud.org/server/7.0/user_manual/webinterface.html).

  #### Accessing your Deployment
  Use the ownCloud URL provided to access your deployment. You will get a
  certificate warning since it's self signed. Login with the ownCloud username
  and password provided.

  #### Logging in via SSH

  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
